# Net Core gRPC reverse proxy Nginx

# This repository

Nginx can terminate, inspect, and route gRPC method calls.

Main use cases for Nginx with gRPC are:
- tls termination proxy,
- rate limits, 
- IP addressâ€‘based access control lists, 
- logging,
- publish multiple gRPC services through a single endpoint
- load balance a cluster of gRPC services

This repository shows how to configure Nginx as reverse proxy for gRPC. 

```
docker build -t grpc-reverseproxy-nginx .\NetCoreGrpc.ReverseProxy.Nginx
